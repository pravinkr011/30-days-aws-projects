ðŸš€ Day 3 DevOps Project Update

Today, I worked on deploying a Load Balancer (ALB) with EC2 instances on AWS.
The goal was to ensure scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance for a web application.

ðŸ”¹ What I did:

Launched multiple EC2 instances with a web server configured.

Created an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic.

Configured target groups and health checks to ensure only healthy instances serve requests.

Validated traffic flow â€“ requests are now balanced automatically across EC2s!

ðŸ’¡ Learning:
This exercise helped me understand how ALB improves resilience and user experience by eliminating single points of failure. Itâ€™s a core step towards building production-grade, scalable infrastructure.

Excited to continue this learning journey, one project at a time! ðŸš€
